### Modifications
- Added a **Return** button to revert to the previous ban/pick step without resetting the entire draft process.
- Changed the background image/theme.
- Added an **"Ended"** state after ban/pick completes — the countdown timer stops and no longer runs once the draft is finished.
- Added 2 new Genshin Impact characters: **Odette** and **Alyosha**, including character images (sourced from Hoyoverse, same as original project).
